## Introduction

The TastyIgniter Local extension enhances your TastyIgniter application with location-based features. It allows you to manage multiple locations, set delivery areas, define opening hours, and much more.

## Features

- **Nearby Location Search:** Allow customers to find the nearest location to their address.
- **Delivery Areas (Zones) Boundary:** Define delivery boundaries and charges for each location.
- **Location Opening Hours:** Set specific opening hours for each location.
- **Location Reviews:** Enable customers to leave reviews for each location.
- **Custom Location Settings:** Add custom fields to locations to store additional information.

## Installation

You can install the extension via composer using the following command:

```bash
composer require tastyigniter/ti-ext-local:"^4.0" -W
```

Run the database migrations to create the required tables:
  
```bash
php artisan igniter:up
```

## Getting started

If you only have one restaurant location, you can switch to single location mode by setting the `IGNITER_LOCATION_MODE` environment variable to `single` in your `.env` file.

```bash
IGNITER_LOCATION_MODE=single
```

By default, the location mode is set to `multiple` which allows you to manage multiple locations.

### GeoCoder

The Local extension uses the `Igniter\Flame\Geolite\Facades\Geocoder` facade to geocode addresses. You can configure the geocoder provider by setting the
**Default Geocoder** field to the desired provider in the _Manage > Settings > General_ admin settings page.

#### Google Maps API Key

To use the Google Maps geocoder provider, you need to set the Google Maps API key in the _Manage > Settings > General_ admin settings page. Follow the instructions on the page to get your API key.

### Review Settings

You can enable or disable reviews by navigating to the _Manage > Settings > Review settings_ admin settings page.

## Usage

### Locations

#### Creating locations

To create a location, navigate to _Manage > Settings > Locations_ in the admin area. Click on the **New** button, fill in the required details such as name, address, and description, and save your changes.

#### Setting current location

To set the current location, use the `Location` facade's `setCurrent` method. Pass the location model instance as the argument. This will store the location in session and make it the current location for the user.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

Location::setCurrent($location);

// Then check if the location is open
if (Location::isOpened()) {
    // Do something...
}
```

After setting the current location, you can retrieve the current location later using the `Location` facade's `current` method.

```php
$location = Location::current();
```

#### Setting user coordinates

To set the user's coordinates, use the `Location` facade's `updateUserPosition` method. Pass the `Igniter\Flame\Geolite\Model\Location` instance as the argument. This will store the user's coordinates in session.

```php
use Igniter\Flame\Geolite\Facades\Geocoder;
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

$userLocation = Geocoder::geocode($userAddress)->first();

Location::updateUserPosition($userLocation);
```

#### Searching nearby locations

To search for nearby locations, use the `Location` facade's `searchByCoordinates` method. Pass the `Igniter\Flame\Geolite\Model\Coordinates` object as the argument.

```php
use Igniter\Flame\Geolite\Facades\Geocoder;
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

$userLocation = Geocoder::geocode($userAddress)->first();

$locations = Location::searchByCoordinates($userLocation->getCoordinates());
```

#### Retrieving minimum order total

To retrieve the minimum order total for a location, use the `minimumOrderTotal` method on the `Location` facade. The method accepts the order type as an argument and returns the minimum order total for the current location.

```php
$minimumOrderTotal = Location::minimumOrderTotal($orderType);
```

#### Checking minimum order total

After retrieving the minimum order total of the current location, you can check if the order total meets the minimum order total using the `checkMinimumOrderTotal` method on the `Location` facade.

```php
if (Location::checkMinimumOrderTotal($orderTotal)) {
    // Do something...
}
```

#### Location-aware controller action

To make the admin [controller list and form action classes](https://tastyigniter.com/docs/extend/controllers#controller-action-classes) aware of the current location, use the `Igniter\Local\Http\Actions\LocationAwareController` action class in your controller.

```php
class MyController extends \Admin\Classes\AdminController
{
    public array $implement = ['Igniter\Local\Http\Actions\LocationAwareController'];

    public array $locationConfig = [
        'applyScopeOnListQuery' => true,
        'applyScopeOnFormQuery' => true,
        'addAbsenceConstraint' => true,
    ]
}
```

In the example above, the `applyScopeOnListQuery` and `applyScopeOnFormQuery` options will apply the location scope to the list and form queries respectively. This way you can filter records based on the current admin user's location. The `addAbsenceConstraint` option when set to `true` will add a constraint to the query to include records that are not associated with any location and when set to `false` will exclude records that are not associated with any location.

#### Location settings

To add custom fields to the location settings form, you must define a `registerLocationSettings` method on your extension class. This method should return an array of settings definition to be added to the location settings form.

```php
public function registerLocationSettings()
{
    return [
        'custom' => [
            'label' => 'Custom settings',
            'description' => 'Custom settings description',
            'icon' => 'fa fa-sliders',
            'priority' => 0,
            'form' => 'author.extension::/models/customsettings',
            'request' => \Author\Extension\Http\Requests\CustomRequest::class,
        ],
    ];
}
```

The settings definition array should contain the following keys:

- `label`: The label of the settings section.
- `description`: The description of the settings section.
- `icon`: The icon class of the settings section.
- `url`: The URL used to link to the settings section. Optional.
- `priority`: The priority of the settings section.
- `permissions`: The permissions required to access the settings section.
- `form`: An array of form fields or path to the form definition file to be used for the settings section.
- `request`: The form request class to be used for the settings section.

### Delivery areas

#### Adding delivery areas

To add a delivery area, navigate to _Restaurant > Settings > Delivery Areas_ in the admin area. Click on the **Add** button, fill in the required details such as name, boundary, and charges, and save your changes.

#### Defining delivery area boundary

To define a delivery area boundary, use the MapView form widget in your delivery area form. This widget allows you to draw the boundary on a map. You can also define area boundary using address components such as country, state, city, and postal code.

You can programmatically set the boundary using the `boundaries` attribute on the `Igniter\Local\Models\LocationArea` model instance.

```php
$locationArea->type = 'address'; // or 'circle' or 'polygon'

$locationArea->boundaries = [
    'polygon' => [
        [
            [0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 1.0],
            [1.0, 1.0],
            [1.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0],
        ],
    ],
    'circle' => [
        'center' => [0.0, 0.0],
        'radius' => 1000,
    ],
    'vertices' => [
        [0.0, 0.0],
        [0.0, 1.0],
        [1.0, 1.0],
        [1.0, 0.0],
    ],
    'components' => [
        ['type' => 'locality', 'value' => 'London', 'priority' => 0],
    ],
];

$locationArea->save();
```

#### Checking a point in boundary

After defining the boundary, you can check if a point is within the boundary using the `checkBoundary` method on the `Igniter\Local\Models\LocationArea` model instance.

```php
$userLocation = Geocoder::geocode($userAddress)->first();

$locationArea->checkBoundary($userLocation->getCoordinates());
```

You can search all delivery areas using the `searchDeliveryArea` method on the `Igniter\Local\Models\Location` model instance.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Models\Location;

$location = Location::find(1);

$locationArea = $location->searchDeliveryArea($userLocation->getCoordinates());
```

Using the `Location` facade's `checkDeliveryCoverage` method, you can check if a point is within the boundaries of the current location. The `$userLocation` argument can be an instance of `Igniter\Flame\Geolite\Model\Location` or null to use the user's coordinates stored in session.

```php
$locationArea = Location::checkDeliveryCoverage($userLocation);
```

#### Defining delivery area charges

To set delivery charges for a delivery area, use the delivery area form. You can set a fixed charge or a charge based on the order total.

You can programmatically set the delivery charges using the `conditions` attribute on the `Igniter\Local\Models\LocationArea` model instance.

```php
$locationArea->conditions = [
    [
        'priority' => 1,
        'amount' => 5.0,
        'type' => 'all', // or 'above' or 'below'
        'total' => 0,
    ],
    [
        'priority' => 2,
        'amount' => 5.0,
        'type' => 'below',
        'total' => 50.0,
    ],
];

$locationArea->save();
```

#### Retrieving delivery area charge

After setting the delivery charges, you can retrieve the matching delivery charge for an order based on the order total using the `deliveryAmount` method on the `Igniter\Local\Classes\CoveredArea` class.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Classes\CoveredArea;

$coveredArea = new CoveredArea($locationArea);

$deliveryAmount = $coveredArea->deliveryAmount($orderTotal);
```

Using the `Location` facade's `deliveryAmount` method, you can retrieve the matching delivery charge for the current location based on the order total.

```php
$deliveryAmount = Location::deliveryAmount($orderTotal);
```

#### Setting user delivery area

To set the user's delivery area, use the `Location` facade's `updateNearbyArea` method. Pass the `Igniter\Local\Models\LocationArea` instance as the argument. This will store the user's delivery area in session.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

Location::updateNearbyArea($locationArea);
```

### Delivery cart condition

A delivery cart condition class that allows you to apply delivery charges to the cart based on the delivery area and order total. This condition is added to your cart automatically when the delivery order type is selected.

You can retrieve the delivery fee applied to the cart using the `getCondition` method on the `Cart` facade.

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

$deliveryCondition = Cart::getCondition('delivery');

$deliveryFee = $deliveryCondition->getValue();
```

### Working hours

#### Creating working hours

To create working hours, navigate to _Restaurant > Settings > Schedules_ in the admin panel. Click on the Add button, fill in the required details such as day, open time, and close time, and save your changes.

You can programmatically set the location's working hours using the `addOpeningHours` method on the `Igniter\Local\Models\Location` model instance. The first argument is an array of working hours where the key is the type of working hours (e.g., opening, delivery, collection) and the value is an array of working hours.

```php
$location->addOpeningHours([
    'opening' => [
        'type' => '24_7', // or 'daily' or 'timesheet' or 'flexible'
        'days' => [],
        'open' => null,
        'close' => null,
        'timesheet' => [],
        'flexible' => [],
    ],
    'delivery' => [
        'type' => 'daily',
        'days' => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
        'open' => '00:00',
        'close' => '23:59',
        'timesheet' => [],
        'flexible' => [],
    ],
    'collection' => [
        'type' => 'timesheet',
        'days' => [],
        'open' => null,
        'close' => null,
        'timesheet' => [
            0 => [
                'day' => 0,
                'hours' => [
                    ['open' => '09:00', 'close' => '12:00'],
                    ['open' => '13:00', 'close' => '17:00'],
                ],
                'status' => 1,
            ]
        ],
        'flexible' => [],
    ],
]);
```

#### Generating timeslots

To generate timeslots for a location, use the `Location` facade. This will generate timeslots for the location based on the working hours and location settings. The `getTimeslot` method returns a collection of timeslots where the key is the date string and value is an array of timeslots.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

$openingTimeslots = Location::openingSchedule()->getTimeslot();

$deliveryTimeslots = Location::deliverySchedule()->getTimeslot();

$collectionTimeslots = Location::collectionSchedule()->getTimeslot();

// For custom types
$customTimeslots = Location::workingSchedule('custom')->getTimeslot();
```

To generate timeslots for a specific day, pass a `DateTime` instance as an argument to the `generateTimeslot` method. This will return a collection of timeslots for the specified day where the key is the timestamp and value is a `DateTime` instance.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

$openingTimeslots = Location::openingSchedule()->generateTimeslot($dateTime);

$deliveryTimeslots = Location::deliverySchedule()->generateTimeslot($dateTime);

$collectionTimeslots = Location::collectionSchedule()->generateTimeslot($dateTime);

// For custom types
$customTimeslots = Location::workingSchedule('custom')->generateTimeslot($dateTime);
```

#### Checking availability

##### Checking a location is open

To check if the current location is open at the current time, use the `isOpen` method of the WorkingSchedule class. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the location is open.

```php
if (Location::deliverySchedule()->isOpen()) {
    // Do something...
}
```

##### Checking a location is opening soon

To check if a location is opening soon, use the `isOpening` method of the WorkingSchedule class. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the location is opening soon.

```php
if (Location::deliverySchedule()->isOpening()) {
    // Do something...
}
```

##### Checking a location is closed

To check if the current location is closed at the current time, use the `isClosed` method of the WorkingSchedule class. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the location is closed.

```php
if (Location::deliverySchedule()->isClosed()) {
    // Do something...
}
```

##### Checking a location is opening at a specific time

To check if a location is open at a specific time, use the `isOpenAt` method of the WorkingSchedule class. Pass a `DateTime` object as the argument. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the location is open at the specified time.

```php
if (Location::deliverySchedule()->isOpenAt($dateTime)) {
    // Do something...
}
```

##### Checking when next a location is open

To check when next a location is open, use the `nextOpenAt` method of the WorkingSchedule class. This method accepts a `DateTime` object as argument and returns a `DateTime` object indicating when the location will next open.

```php
$nextOpenAt = Location::deliverySchedule()->nextOpenAt($dateTime);
```

##### Checking a location is closed at a specific time

To check if a location is closed at a specific time, use the `isClosedAt` method of the WorkingSchedule class. Pass a `DateTime` object as the argument. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the location is closed at the specified time.

```php
if (Location::deliverySchedule()->isClosedAt($dateTime)) {
    // Do something...
}
```

#### Setting exceptions

To set exceptions for the location's working hours, use the `setExceptions` method of the WorkingSchedule class. Pass an array of exceptions as the argument. The array should have the date string as the key and an array of times as the value.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

Location::deliverySchedule()->setExceptions([
    '2022-01-01' => [
        ['01:00', '04:59'],
        ['18:00', '23:59'],
    ],
    '2022-12-25' => [],
]);
```

#### Setting user order schedule time

To set the user's order fulfilment time, use the `Location` facade's `updateScheduleTimeSlot` method. The first argument is a `DateTime` object, and the second argument is a boolean value indicating whether the user is ordering for ASAP. This will store the user's order time in session.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;

Location::updateScheduleTimeSlot($dateTime, $isAsap);
```

### Reviews

#### Reviewing orders and reservations

To enable users to review orders and reservations, navigate to _Manage > Settings > Review settings_ in the admin area and enable the **Allow Reviews** option.

Programmatically, you can create reviews for an order or reservation using the `Igniter\Local\Models\Review` model instance.

```php
use Igniter\Local\Models\Review;
use Igniter\Cart\Models\Order;
// use Igniter\Reservation\Models\Reservation;

$record = Order::find(1);
// $record = Reservation::find(1);

$review = $record->leaveReview([
    'quality' => 5,
    'delivery' => 5,
    'service' => 5,
    'review_text' => 'Great food and service!',
]);
```
